## 0. Executive summary (read this first)

Three things matter and you should internalise them before you draft the post:

1. **r/LocalLLaMA is RIGHT NOW saturated with Qwen3.6-27B speed posts.** In the
   past ~7 days there have been at least seven separate "I made Qwen3.6-27B fast
   on \<my GPU\>" posts on the subreddit. The bar for a generic speed-flex has
   moved up dramatically. **Your differentiator is Windows + portable launcher,
   not the raw 64.5 tok/s number.**
2. **Your 64.5 tok/s number is good but not headline-shattering.** A community
   member already posted 80–82 tok/s on a single 3090 with vLLM + AutoRound +
   MTP n=3 + TurboQuant 3-bit KV at 125k context (`Important_Quote_1180`'s
   comment in `1sw21op`). Two days ago `tedivm` shipped a Docker container
   doing 118 tok/s on 2x 3090 with TP=2 + Lorbus + MTP. The honest framing is
   **"on Windows, with no Docker / no WSL, with prebuilt wheels and a one-click
   launcher, here's the same recipe people are running on Linux"** — that is a
   real distinct contribution. Saying "fastest 3090 you've ever seen" will get
   you nailed in the comments by the same people who post that stack daily.
3. **The best-performing Reddit posts in this exact niche are
   reproducible-recipe posts with exact CLI flags, not narrative posts.** The
   front-runners (`1sw21op` 245↑, `1sx8uok` 646↑, `1rianwb` 704↑ from 58 days
   ago, `1sy0qj5` 115↑) all lead with a flags-or-table block in the first
   screenful. Lead with the table. Save the personality for comments.

If you internalise just those three points and draft accordingly, the post will
land. The rest of this document expands them.

## 1. The competitive landscape — what r/LocalLLaMA users are doing with Qwen3.6-27B on consumer hardware right now

### 1.1 Reference benchmark wall (last ~10 days, sourced from threads cited below)

| Apple M2 Pro 36GB | mlx | — | "no boost from vllm" speculation | — | `1sw21op` (hannibal27, no answer) |

**Key takeaways for positioning:**

- **vLLM has eaten the speed-record bracket on consumer NVIDIA.** Five of the
  top eight TPS numbers above are vLLM. llama.cpp + DFlash is a credible #2.
  Mainline llama.cpp at 43 tok/s is now the slow option on a 3090.
- **The Lorbus AutoRound INT4 quant has effectively become the de facto
  speed-king quant for 27B on 3090/5090.** Every fast vLLM run uses it. You
  are using it. Good.
- **MTP n=3 is the universal sweet spot.** n=2 is "wasted speed", n=5+ has
  diminishing returns and slowdown risk per `1rianwb`. A few people are doing
  n=6 (you) but expect to be questioned.
- **TurboQuant 3-bit KV (TheTom fork / buun fork) is what people use to fit
  big context on 16-24GB.** You are using fp8_e4m3 KV. Be ready for "have you
  tried TurboQuant?" comments — you can answer "yes, fp8_e4m3 was the
  Pareto-optimal point in our coherence harness; turbo3 lost about X% on our
  needle test."
- **Windows is conspicuously absent.** Across ~25 high-quality threads I
  pulled, the only Windows-native success stories are:
  - `1sy0qj5` (Tempest_nano) — buun-llama-cpp on Windows 5080 laptop, 25 tok/s.
    Notes "It was driving me up the wall that I couldn't hit 128k context".
  - `1svnmgo` (Due-Project-7507) — explicit Windows build instructions for
    buun-llama-cpp. 41 upvotes for a tutorial-style post.
  - `1sw2fjc` (Ok_Mine189) — Windows vs Lubuntu llama.cpp benchmark. Lubuntu
    consistently 4–8% faster on TG, 6–22% on PP, **dramatic 109–143% faster
    on hybrid CPU/GPU**. WSL specifically: Optimal-Bass-5246 in `1sw21op`
    reports "85tps in WSL to 160tps in Ubuntu with same exact settings"; same
    user says "yes, dual-boot, only getting 70-80 tps in WSL".
  - `1sxz548` (Ok-Measurement-1575) — "llama.cpp tool calling issues on
    Windows only", 0↑, 9 comments. The frustrated Windows user.
- **There is no native vLLM-on-Windows post on r/LocalLLaMA in the past
  year.** Searches for `"vllm windows"`, `"windows vllm"`, `"vllm on windows"`,
  `"WSL2 vllm"`, `"SystemPanic"`, `"vllm windows port"` all return 3 unrelated
  hits each. **There is a wide-open lane for "first credible vLLM on Windows
  story".**

### 1.2 Hardware split

Single 3090 is by far the most common substrate for these speed posts (probably
the most-used "serious" consumer GPU on the subreddit). 5090 is overrepresented
because its owners post a lot. Strix Halo is asked-about more than it is
delivered (`1sxbvux` 38↑, 89c, mostly disappointment). 5060 Ti 16GB is the
budget rising star. 4090 is curiously underrepresented in 27B posts — there
are few "I have a 4090, here's my recipe" posts compared to 3090 / 5090.

### 1.3 Runtime split

vLLM and llama.cpp are the only two runtimes that show up on the speed
leaderboard. ollama is mentioned only as "I run ollama and it's slow"
(commenters in multiple threads). LM Studio is mentioned as "I tried it on
16GB and it was really really slow". mlx shows up only on Mac threads.
exllamav3 is essentially absent. SGLang shows up zero times in 27B speed
posts I pulled.

### 1.4 Spec-decode landscape

- **MTP via vLLM** is now well-documented; every fast vLLM run uses it.
- **DFlash** (tree-verify spec decode) is the new entrant — `1sx8uok` 646↑.
  llama.cpp port shipped this week. No multi-GPU yet; tool calling shaky.
- **ngram spec-decode** (mainline llama.cpp `--spec-type ngram-mod`) — second
  pass on same codebase 2–3x faster (`1sx8uok` bonobomaster, drrck82).
- **PP=2 + MTP is broken in vLLM 0.19** — confirmed in `1swmrov`:
  `NotImplementedError: Pipeline parallelism is not supported for this model.
  Supported models implement the SupportsPP interface.` Issue
  https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/36643. **This validates one of
  your scope statements.** Use it.

### 1.5 What people are complaining about (in 27B speed threads, last week)

These will be the inbound questions on launch day. Tagged for response strategy
in §4:

- "Tool calling drops mid-session." (template/parser issue) — `1sxlnjd`,
  `1syh4sd`, `1sx8uok` Hodler-mane.
- "MTP+PP gives `SupportsPP` error" — `1swmrov`. Your CPU-relay patch sidesteps this. Good talking point.
- "FULL cudagraph mode garbles output with MTP" — `1sw21op` Important_Quote_1180.
  Your stack uses TRITON_ATTN; mention.
- "WSL costs 50%+ throughput" — `1sw21op` Optimal-Bass-5246. **This is your
  killer angle.** Native Windows = no WSL tax.
- "Quality of INT4 vs Q8 is debated, especially for coding" — `1sx8uok`
  Tiny_Arugula_5648, FullstackSensei. Have an answer.
- "Strix Halo is too slow" — `1sxbvux`. Out of scope for you.
- "Tunableop / FlashInfer takes 30s startup" — `1sysyz2`, `1sw21op`. Yours
  too, expect the question.

## 2. How fork / tweak / config-share posts are received in r/LocalLLaMA

I pulled 8 representative posts that match the shape of your launch. Pattern
analysis below.

### 2.1 The high-watermark precedent: `1rianwb` (58 days ago)

> **"Running Qwen3.5 27b dense with 170k context at 100+t/s decode and ~1500t/s prefill on 2x3090"**
> u/JohnTheNerd3 — 704↑ · 143 comments · [Discussion]
> https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1rianwb/

This is the closest existing post to yours: Qwen-27B-dense, 2x3090, vLLM,
patches, MTP, custom build script. **704 upvotes** with this structure:

1. One-line hook: hardware + model + headline number + secondary number.
2. 30-second video showing the response speed live.
3. "To achieve this, I had to:" — bulleted list of 5 specific things.
4. Acknowledgment of his own custom fork (cherry-picked PRs) with link.
5. Full launch script verbatim in a code block.
6. "Edit: PR merged, fork no longer needed."

**Lessons for you:** Lead with the number-context-hardware triple. Show, do
not tell. List your patches as bullets, not paragraphs. Link the fork with
"won't be heavily maintained" caveat (or, in your case, "actively maintained
because Windows-niche"). Always paste the launch script verbatim.

### 2.2 `1sx3gsl` — tedivm Docker container (37↑, 23c, 2 days ago)

> **"Simple to use vLLM Docker Container for Qwen3.6 27b with Lorbus AutoRound INT4 quant and MTP speculative decoding - 118 tokens/second on 2x 3090s"**
> https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1sx3gsl/

Title is **literally a punch list of the value prop:** "Simple to use" +
"vLLM Docker Container" + "Lorbus AutoRound INT4" + "MTP speculative" +
"118 tokens/second" + "2x 3090s". You can copy this template wholesale.

The post body is a single GitHub link with a one-liner and a
README.md-as-readme. The README has a "tested on" section, a "speed flags"
section, and a docker compose file. The comments split into:
(a) "what context size on a single GPU" — answered with examples,
(b) "what's max ctx" — answered with examples,
(c) "where are the cli params?" — answered with link,
(d) "your work was the foundation" (k0zakinio of `noonghunna/qwen36-27b-single-3090`).

The exchange between `tedivm` and `k0zakinio` ("Good to see the approach from
my repo didn't go to waste!") is the model interaction you want with
SystemPanic if they're around.

### 2.3 `1sw21op` — Kindly-Cantaloupe978 / 5090 100tps (245↑, 99c, 3 days ago)

> **"Qwen3.6-27B-INT4 clocking 100 tps with 256k context length on 1x RTX 5090 via vllm 0.19"**
> https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1sw21op/

Highest-vote vLLM-tuning post in the past week. Body structure:

1. One-line credit ("thanks to the community... this improves on yesterday's
   recipe"), with link to yesterday's post.
2. Model link to Lorbus.
3. Three bullet points: MTP supported, KLD decent, 256k native fit.
4. **The TPS number on its own line, bold-equivalent.**
5. The full vLLM launch config in a code block.

That's the entire post. **No marketing, no story, no asks.** It hit 245 with
the model card + flags. The comments are mostly people pasting their own
configs and benchmarks back at OP. Notice: even his title is constrained —
hardware first ("1x RTX 5090"), then quant ("INT4"), then the runtime ("vllm
0.19"), then the number. Hardware before number.

### 2.4 `1sx8uok` — Luce DFlash (646↑, 175c, 1 day ago) — the controversial high-flier

> **"Luce DFlash: Qwen3.6-27B at up to 2x throughput on a single RTX 3090"**
> https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1sx8uok/

Highest-vote of the week in this category. Body:

1. "Hey fellow Llamas, your time is precious, so I'll keep it short." — sets
   register: candid, low-marketing.
2. One-paragraph elevator pitch: "GGUF port of DFlash, standalone C++/CUDA on
   ggml, runs on a single 24 GB RTX 3090."
3. Repo link with license badge.
4. Benchmark context: "1.98x mean over autoregressive on Qwen3.6 across
   HumanEval/GSM8K/Math500, with zero retraining."
5. Exact build commands (cmake + huggingface-cli + run).
6. "No Python runtime in the engine, no llama.cpp install, no vLLM, no SGLang."
   — clear positioning vs alternatives.
7. Bullet list of features: KV compression, ubatch auto-bump, sliding window FA, OAI server.
8. Three-bench table (HumanEval / Math500 / GSM8K / Mean) with AR vs DFlash columns.
9. **Constraints section, explicit:** "CUDA only, greedy verify only, no Metal/ROCm/multi-GPU. Repo started single-3090."
10. "Feedback more than welcome!"

**This is the textbook structure.** Your launch should follow it almost
exactly. Note especially: **constraints section is in the post body, not
deferred to the README.** This bought him enormous goodwill — the people
correcting the hype in comments mostly weren't dunking, because the post had
already disclaimed.

The contentious comments (Tiny_Arugula_5648, PrysmX) attacked **quantization
quality**, not the post itself. He responded by adding the use case to the
post. That's the right move.

### 2.5 `1svnmgo` — Quant Qwen3.6-27B on 16GB tutorial (41↑, 17c, 3 days ago)

> **"Quant Qwen3.6-27B on 16GB VRAM with 100k context length"** [Tutorial | Guide]
> https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1svnmgo/

A tutorial-flair post from a non-celebrity author hit 41 with: hardware
spec → KLD comparison table → exact build/run commands → opencode config JSON.
Pure recipe. No story. The crowd ate it up because **it's reproducible**.

### 2.6 `1sw2fjc` — Windows vs Lubuntu llama.cpp benchmark (75↑, 69c, 3 days ago)

> **"Benchmark: Windows 11 vs Lubuntu 26.04 on Llama.cpp (RTX 5080 + i9-14900KF). I didn't expect the gap to be this big."**
> https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1sw2fjc/

**Directly relevant to your positioning.** Author admits "I used AI to help me
write this post" in the first paragraph, which the comments accepted without
issue. Body is a 5-row markdown table (Win11 prompt | Lub prompt | Diff |
Win11 gen | Lub gen | Diff) followed by 3 takeaways followed by raw command
logs.

Tone is: "I was wondering, here's the data, this is the actual conclusion."
No apologetics, no marketing. The top comment is FullstackSensei roasting
Windows scheduling. **That comment thread will exist on your post. Be ready.**

### 2.7 `1sxaj8g` — AMD R9700 vLLM patch (24↑, 41c, 1 day ago)

> **"For the 5 people here running vLLM on multiple R9700s, you need to patch in support for AITER Unified Attention."**
> https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1sxaj8g/

**Most directly analogous post to yours.** It's a niche-hardware vLLM patch.
Title is self-deprecating about audience size (`"5 people"`), which is
charming and honest — and the post got 24↑ + 41 dense technical comments.
The OP showed up in the comments to debug other people's setups in real time;
that's how the post grew. Take note: **showing up to debug actively after
the post is what differentiates a post that fizzles from a post that builds
a community around your fork.**

You should consider a self-deprecating Windows variant: "For the 12 people
trying to run vLLM on Windows..."

### 2.8 `1sy0qj5` — Pablo_the_brave 16GB IQ4_XS (115↑, 42c, 1 day ago)

Strong example of **"I found a regression and reverted the relevant commit"**
type post. Frontloads the comparison table, dumps the perplexity numbers, has
multiple KV-quant variants benchmarked. Repo of his custom GGUF on HF with
links. Top comment is "just open a PR bro" (75 upvotes), which Pablo gets
roasted for. **Lesson:** if any of your patches are upstreamable, mention
the upstream PR plan in the post body so the "open a PR bro" comment doesn't
land. Two of your three patches go upstream eventually — say so.

### 2.9 General length / formatting / convention findings

- **Length.** Top-quartile launch posts in this niche are 250–800 words.
  Don't go past 1000 unless you're doing a benchmark dump like `1sy0qj5`
  (1500 words, 115↑ — only works if every paragraph is data).
- **Formatting.** Markdown tables are universal. Code blocks for launch
  commands are mandatory. Bullet lists, not paragraphs, for "what changed"
  / "what's tested". No preambles ("Hey everyone, long-time lurker..."). The
  Luce post's "Hey fellow Llamas, your time is precious, so I'll keep it
  short" is the maximum permitted opener and even then borderline.
- **Hardware in the title is mandatory** for performance posts. Every
  high-vote post has the GPU model in the title.
- **Self-deprecation works.** "For the 5 people running vLLM on R9700s",
  "I'd jump on runpod...but they don't have it", "I'm not a dev but..." all
  outperform earnest enthusiasm.
- **Asking for feedback at the end works.** "Feedback more than welcome!"
  (`1sx8uok`), "let me know how it goes" (`1sx8uok` author replies), "let
  me know if there are any issues with the GitHub" (Optimal-Bass-5246) all
  appear at the end of well-received posts.
- **Posts under [Resources] flair seem to outperform [Discussion]** for
  this kind of release. Use [Resources].

## 3. Recommendations for the launch post

### 3.1 Three title variants

#### Variant A — hardware-flex (high risk, high reward)

> **"Qwen3.6-27B at 64.5 tok/s on a single RTX 3090, native Windows — patched vLLM 0.19 fork with portable launcher"**

- Pros: hardware-first (proven format), specific number, "native Windows"
  is the distinguishing word.
- Cons: 64.5 tok/s is below the 80–82 tok/s that `Important_Quote_1180`
  posted. **The first comment will be "I get 80 on Linux".** You'll spend
  the comment thread defending the gap.
- Verdict: **Do not lead with this.** Save 64.5 for the body.

#### Variant B — problem-solution (recommended)

> **"vllm-windows: native Windows fork of vLLM with prebuilt wheel + portable launcher — Qwen3.6-27B at 64.5 tok/s on a single 3090, no WSL"**

- Pros: leads with the problem ("vLLM on Windows is hard"), the artefact
  ("prebuilt wheel + portable launcher"), the proof (the model + tok/s),
  and the kicker ("no WSL"). Also tells anyone with a 3090 + Windows that
  this post is for them.
- Cons: long. Some readers will only see the first half.
- Verdict: **This is the recommended title.** It positions you not as
  "fastest 3090" but as "the Windows port that finally has portable
  speed-king configs". Different category from Kindly-Cantaloupe978 et al.

#### Variant C — candid-and-modest

> **"For the 12 people trying to run vLLM natively on Windows: a fork with the patches, prebuilt wheel, and a one-click launcher"**

- Pros: nods directly to `1sxaj8g` ("for the 5 people"). Conveys scope
  honesty up front. Will earn goodwill with the technical crowd.
- Cons: doesn't communicate the speed angle in the title; people who'd be
  excited by "Qwen3.6-27B at 64.5 tok/s" never click.
- Verdict: solid backup, especially if you've already burned Variant B in
  a teaser somewhere.

### 3.2 Recommended post body (full markdown)

Use [Resources] flair. Suggested length: ~600 words. Below is a complete draft.

>
> ## The three patches
>
> 1. **CPU-relay for Gloo collectives.** Windows has no real NCCL; vLLM's
>    distributed paths hang on `isend/irecv_tensor_dict` (PP) and
>    `all_reduce/broadcast/send/recv` (TP). The fork relays both through
>    the CPU. PP=2 works. TP=2 also works — but it's slow on PCIe (about
>    7.5 tok/s in our tests), so we ship PP=2 as the multi-GPU default.
> 2. **`<tool_call>` as implicit `</think>`** — mirror of upstream
>    [vllm#35687](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/35687).
>    Without this, the Qwen3 reasoning parser eats tool calls mid-session.
>    Already merged upstream in v0.20.0; included here so the 0.19 wheel
>    has the fix.
> 3. **Wildcard model name in the OpenAI server** so harnesses (Cline,
>    Cursor, Codex CLI) don't need to match `--served-model-name`.
>
> Patches 2 and 3 will go to upstream as PRs. Patch 1 is too
> Windows-specific to merge.
>
> ## Quickstart
>
> ```
> # 1. Download the launcher zip from the Release
> # 2. Unzip
> # 3. Double-click start.bat
> # 4. Pick "Speed king" snapshot, hit Run
> # OpenAI-compatible endpoint at http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1
> ```
>
> Or, if you have your own vLLM environment:
>
> ```
> pip install vllm-0.19.0+devnen.1-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl
> vllm serve Lorbus/Qwen3.6-27B-int4-AutoRound \
>   --max-model-len 90000 --gpu-memory-utilization 0.93 \
>   --kv-cache-dtype fp8_e4m3 --max-num-seqs 1 \
>   --quantization auto_round --reasoning-parser qwen3 \
>   --tool-call-parser qwen3_coder --enable-auto-tool-choice \
>   --enable-prefix-caching --enable-chunked-prefill \
>   --speculative-config '{"method":"mtp","num_speculative_tokens":6}'
> ```
>
> ## Honest scope
>
> - Tested on **Windows 10 with 2× RTX 3090** (Ampere sm_86) and the
>   **Lorbus AutoRound INT4** quant. Other quants probably work; other
>   GPUs probably work; haven't tested.
> - **GPU0 with desktop load doesn't work** — keep desktop on iGPU /
>   second card.
> - Single-tenant single-model. Not for multi-user serving.
> - **TP=2 is technically working but practically too slow** on Windows
>   over the CPU relay (~7.5 tok/s). PP=2 is the multi-GPU recommendation.
> - **Linux users: this is not for you.** The native Linux vLLM stack is
>   strictly better. This fork is for the Windows desktops that for
>   whatever reason can't or won't switch.
>
> ## What would help
>
> - Other 3090 owners on Windows running the snapshot and posting their
>   numbers + chat-template / harness combo.
> - 4090 / 5090 / 5060 Ti owners on Windows confirming the wheel loads
>   and the speed-king snapshot runs.
> - Bug reports against the GitHub issue tracker for tool-call edge
>   cases I haven't seen.
>
> Repo + Release: github.com/devnen/vllm-windows
>
> Built on `SystemPanic/vllm-windows`, Apache-2.0, credited in repo and
> release notes.

End of recommended body. Notes:

- **Word count:** ~620 words. In the sweet spot.
- **Hooks the comment thread.** "What would help" gives readers a clear
  invitation to test, which generates exactly the comment-and-paste-numbers
  thread shape that makes posts grow.
- **Pre-empts ~5 of the 7 likely complaint categories** (WSL, scope, TP=2,
  Linux, "why not upstream").
- **Numbers are stated honestly.** 64.5 tok/s with the asterisk that
  somebody else got 80 on Linux is fine because we're not claiming to be
  the fastest 3090 — we're claiming to be the fastest 3090 *on Windows
  without WSL*.

### 3.3 Length and formatting cheat-sheet

| Element | Convention | Source |

## 4. Predicted comment thread + draft responses

For each predicted comment category I include (a) example wording (quoting
prior threads), (b) likely upvote impact if mishandled, (c) a 2–4 sentence
draft response in the OP's voice — confident, candid, technical, no
marketing speak.

### 4.1 Skeptics: "those numbers look fake / how are you measuring"

**Likely wording:** *"You've seen 100t/s for 27b on a 3090?"*
(Ok-Measurement-1575, `1sx8uok`); *"Can you confirm the numbers with
llama-benchy?"* (Ok-Measurement-1575, `1sysyz2`); *"would be useful to see
acceptance length variance per benchmark and one multi-turn coding session
run end to end"* (rafio77, `1sx8uok`).

**Severity if mishandled:** medium — they're not hostile, just want proof.
Mishandling looks like getting defensive. They're easy to win over.

**Draft response:**

> Fair. The 64.5 tok/s is a 1024-token decode on a 24k-token public prompt
> (link in repo `bench/`), `vllm bench serve` measurement, RTX 3090 at 350W,
> Win 10. MTP acceptance rate logs are in `bench/run_*.log` —
> mean acceptance length 3.4–3.9 with n=6. The harness, the prompt, and
> the stdout are all checked in so anyone with a 3090 can repeat it. If
> you run it and get something different, please open an issue with your
> log and I'll dig in.

### 4.2 Hardware mismatches: "doesn't work on my 4090 / Strix Halo / ROCm"

**Likely wording:** *"Any chance this will work on my AMD 7900XT with 20GB
VRAM?"* (vick2djax, `1sx8uok`); *"What about Strix Halo"*; *"ROCm support?"*

**Severity:** low — but high frequency. Need a single canonical answer.

**Draft response:**

> Honest answer: I haven't tested on anything other than 2× 3090 Win 10.
> Patch 1 (CPU-relay Gloo) should work on any Windows + CUDA setup; the
> Lorbus quant is INT4 so any sm_75+ NVIDIA card should run it; the
> launcher snapshots have GPU-memory-utilization knobs. If you try it on a
> 4090/5090/5060 Ti and it loads, post numbers in the issue tracker and
> I'll add a "tested on" row to the README. ROCm is a no — vLLM ROCm on
> Windows is its own world.

### 4.3 License / attribution: "are you allowed to redistribute SystemPanic's wheel?"

**Likely wording:** *"You're forking SystemPanic's work — is that
attributed?"* / *"Apache-2.0?"*

**Severity:** medium — failing here is the kind of thing that gets a post
removed and your reputation singed. Have the answer fully prepared.

**Draft response:**

> Apache-2.0 throughout. SystemPanic/vllm-windows is Apache-2.0,
> upstream vLLM is Apache-2.0, my fork is Apache-2.0, the prebuilt wheel
> ships with the LICENSE and NOTICE files intact. SystemPanic is credited
> in the repo README, the release notes, and as the upstream remote in
> git. If SystemPanic surfaces and would like the credit framed
> differently I'll update on request.

### 4.4 Linux requests: "Linux version when?"

**Likely wording:** *"Why not just run mainline vLLM on Linux?"* / *"Linux
support?"*

**Severity:** low — answer is "out of scope and you should run mainline".

**Draft response:**

> Yeah — if you can run Linux, run mainline vLLM. The whole reason this
> fork exists is that Windows-without-WSL has no working vLLM stack today.
> Patch 1 (CPU-relay Gloo) is unnecessary on Linux because Linux has real
> NCCL. Patches 2 and 3 are Windows-agnostic and I'm sending them upstream
> as PRs.

### 4.5 Coherence challenges: "how do you know the output isn't degenerate?"

**Likely wording:** *"FULL cudagraph mode garbles output with MTP — how do
you know yours isn't?"* (paraphrasing Important_Quote_1180, `1sw21op`);
*"Is INT4 actually usable for coding?"* (Tiny_Arugula_5648, `1sx8uok`).

**Severity:** medium-high. This is the question that, mishandled, causes
the post to be retroactively branded as benchmaxxing. Answer with data.

**Draft response:**

> Same recipe as the Linux 80 tok/s posters — Lorbus AutoRound + MTP +
> Qwen3 reasoning parser + qwen3_coder tool parser. We use TRITON_ATTN
> and run with chunked prefill + prefix caching, not FULL cudagraph, so
> the MTP-garbling failure mode in `1sw21op` doesn't apply. The repo
> ships a coherence battery — needle-in-haystack at 32k/64k/90k, a 24k
> code summarisation prompt with reference completion, and a tool-call
> regression test. Latest run is checked in at `bench/coherence_*.json`.
> If a quant or KV setting fails, an issue with the offending input is
> the fastest path to a fix.

### 4.6 Comparison demands: "vs llama.cpp / vs ollama / vs LM Studio"

**Likely wording:** *"Why this over llama.cpp?"* / *"How does this compare
to LM Studio?"*

**Severity:** low — answer with positioning, not benchmarks (because
benchmarking against a llama.cpp DFlash setup at 78 tok/s is not flattering).

**Draft response:**

> Different niche. llama.cpp is the right answer for most people on most
> hardware — it has wider GPU support, better quant ecosystem, easier
> setup. vLLM has two things llama.cpp doesn't have at this exact moment
> on this exact 27B-on-3090 niche: a working MTP n>3 path and the AutoRound
> INT4 fast path. If you want maximum tok/s on Lorbus 27B + 3090 + Windows
> single-user, this is currently the fastest stack I know of. Otherwise,
> use llama.cpp (or Luce DFlash if/when it stabilises).

### 4.7 "Why fork instead of upstream PR?"

**Likely wording:** *"just open a PR bro"* (xeeff, `1sy0qj5`, 75↑)

**Severity:** high. This is the most common dunk on tweak-fork posts.
Pre-empt in body, but also have a comment-ready answer.

**Draft response:**

> Two of three patches are going upstream — the implicit-`</think>` fix
> (already merged as v0.20.0) and the wildcard served-model-name change
> are PR candidates. The CPU-relay Gloo patch is too Windows-specific to
> belong in mainline vLLM — Linux has real NCCL, so the patched code
> path is dead code there. Hence the fork. If a vLLM maintainer disagrees
> and wants it upstream behind a `VLLM_USE_CPU_GLOO_RELAY` env, I'm happy
> to draft the PR.

### 4.8 Performance dunks: "I get 80 on Linux"

**Likely wording:** *"I push 80 toks on my one 3090. It's likely one
unlock or optimization away from 100"* (Important_Quote_1180, multiple
threads).

**Severity:** medium — easy to mishandle by being defensive.

**Draft response:**

> Yep, you're right — Important_Quote_1180 is at 82 sustained on Linux
> with TurboQuant 3-bit KV and PIECEWISE cudagraph. If you can run that
> stack, run that stack. The angle here is specifically "what does the
> same recipe look like when you cannot run WSL or Linux", which is a
> non-zero number of Windows desktops. The 64.5 we get on Windows
> matches roughly what people are reporting through WSL on the same
> recipe, with the wins coming from skipping WSL's overhead rather than
> any new optimisation.

### 4.9 Strix Halo people, Mac people

**Likely wording:** *"Will this work on Strix Halo?"* (cf. `1sxbvux`)

**Severity:** low. Clear redirect.

**Draft response:**

> No — vLLM doesn't have a usable Strix Halo path today and this fork
> doesn't change that. For Strix Halo on Qwen3.6-27B the current honest
> answer is llama.cpp Vulkan and you're getting 7–12 tok/s
> (`r/LocalLLaMA/1sxbvux`). For Macs, mlx is the native path.

### 4.10 Tool-call breakage reports

**Likely wording:** *"I'm getting 'Now let me...' then nothing"*
(Acceptable_Adagio_91, `1syh4sd`); *"the enhanced template eats tool calls
once history piles up"* (Ha_Deal_5079).

**Severity:** medium. Lots of users have been bitten by this in the past
two weeks — it's the open wound of the Qwen3.6 ecosystem right now.

**Draft response:**

> Patch 2 (mirror of vllm#35687) targets exactly that failure mode —
> `<tool_call>` is treated as an implicit `</think>` so the reasoning
> parser doesn't swallow the call. Confirmed working on this stack with
> the qwen3_coder parser and the qwen3.5-enhanced.jinja chat template.
> If you reproduce a failure, open an issue with the harness, the chat
> template, and a curl + raw response — we have a regression test that
> can be extended.

## 5. Open risks and recommendations

### 5.1 Risks

- **Risk that 64.5 tok/s is read as "slower than what I get on Linux"
  and dismissed.** Mitigation: position around Windows + portable, not
  raw speed. Mentioned in the body. **Do not put 64.5 tok/s in the
  title.**
- **Risk that the post is read as a tweak post when "open a PR bro" lands.**
  Mitigation: mention upstream PR plan in the body up front (done in
  draft). The fork-only patch is justified explicitly.
- **Risk of getting roasted on telemetry / wheel safety.** Mitigation:
  attach SHA256SUMS, mention "no telemetry, no phone-home", offer to
  publish the wheel build script.
- **Risk that the launcher zip is treated as suspicious binary.**
  Mitigation: ship the launcher source separately, document the build
  step, attach SHA256SUMS for both wheel and zip.
- **Risk of getting compared unfavourably to `noonghunna/club-3090`,**
  the community config repo collected in `1sy9llm` comments. Mitigation:
  acknowledge it explicitly. ("noonghunna's club-3090 repo is the place
  to look if you can run Linux.")
- **Risk that `Important_Quote_1180`, `tedivm`, `Optimal-Bass-5246`, or
  `Kindly-Cantaloupe978` show up in the comments and out-benchmark you.**
  Mitigation: they will. Be ready to engage warmly. Their stacks are
  Linux. You don't compete with them, you're orthogonal.

### 5.2 Strategic recommendations

1. **Post timing.** r/LocalLLaMA traffic peaks ~14:00–18:00 UTC weekdays.
   Tuesday or Wednesday morning US East is consistently the highest-vote
   slot for [Resources] posts (cf. all the recent high-vote posts I
   pulled — most were posted in that window).
2. **Show up in the comments for the first 6 hours.** `1sxaj8g`'s
   AustinM731 grew that thread by debugging in real time. Expect to
   spend 6 hours actively replying.
3. **Tag SystemPanic if they have a Reddit account.** If not, mention the
   credit explicitly in the body.
4. **Have a follow-up post ready.** If the launch lands, a 7-day-later
   "what I learned from launching `vllm-windows`" post (numbers, bugs
   reported, fixes shipped) historically does very well — see
   `1sw21op` referencing yesterday's 80-tps post, and JohnTheNerd3's
   `1rianwb` follow-up cadence.
5. **Cross-post.** r/LocalLLM (smaller, friendlier) and r/Oobabooga
   (Windows-heavy) are reasonable cross-posts 24h after the main post.
   Do **not** cross-post to r/StableDiffusion or r/MachineLearning
   (different audiences, will dilute).

## 6. TL;DR cheat-sheet for launch day

> **Title (recommended):** *"vllm-windows: native Windows fork of vLLM with prebuilt wheel + portable launcher — Qwen3.6-27B at 64.5 tok/s on a single 3090, no WSL"*
> **Flair:** [Resources]
> **Length:** ~600 words
> **Lead:** "Linux is where vLLM lives. Getting it to work natively on Windows means..."
> **Required body sections:** What you get → Numbers (table) → The three patches → Quickstart → Honest scope → What would help.
> **Required CTA:** "Other 3090 owners on Windows: post your numbers."
>
> **Top 5 things you must do:**
>
> 1. Don't claim "fastest 3090". Claim "fastest 3090 on Windows without WSL." Different bracket.
> 2. Put the constraints (Win-only, 3090-only, GPU0 desktop conflict, TP=2 unusable, single-tenant) in the body, not the README.
> 3. Open with the table, not the story.
> 4. Mention the upstream PR plan in the body to defuse "open a PR bro".
> 5. Stay in the comments for the first 6 hours.
>
> **Top 5 things you must not do:**
>
> 1. Don't bury the SystemPanic credit.
> 2. Don't put 64.5 tok/s in the title without "Windows" / "no WSL" next to it.
> 3. Don't say "production-ready", "blazing-fast", or "revolutionary". This sub allergic to all three.
> 4. Don't get defensive when `Important_Quote_1180` posts 82 tok/s on Linux. Agree, redirect.
> 5. Don't promise multi-GPU TP. Ship PP=2 only as the multi-GPU path.
>
> **Comment-thread drafts ready to paste (see §4):** skeptics, hardware
> mismatches, license, Linux, coherence, comparison, why-fork, "I get 80",
> Strix Halo, tool calls. 10 categories, all pre-drafted.
>
> **Reference posts to read in full before launch:**
> - `1sx8uok` (Luce DFlash, 646↑) — structure
> - `1sw21op` (5090 100tps, 245↑) — recipe-only style
> - `1sxaj8g` (R9700 vLLM patch, 24↑) — niche-hardware patch tone
> - `1rianwb` (2x3090 vLLM 100tps, 704↑, 58d ago) — gold standard precedent
> - `1sx3gsl` (tedivm Docker, 37↑) — Lorbus + MTP + Win-aware comments
> - `1sw2fjc` (Win vs Lubuntu, 75↑) — Windows-positioning thread to study
>
> **Numbers to know cold:**
> - Your headline: 64.5 tok/s @ 90k ctx, 53.4 @ 127k, 43.5 @ 160k PP=2.
> - Linux 3090 baseline to acknowledge: 80–82 tok/s @ 125k (Important_Quote_1180, vLLM dev21 + TurboQuant 3-bit + PIECEWISE).
> - Linux 5090 ceiling: 120–161 tok/s @ 256k (Optimal-Bass-5246, Genesis patches).
> - WSL tax to cite: 85→160 tok/s when leaving WSL for Ubuntu (Optimal-Bass-5246, `1sw21op`).
> - PP+MTP broken: vllm-project/vllm#36643.
> - Upstream PR you mirror: vllm-project/vllm#35687.
